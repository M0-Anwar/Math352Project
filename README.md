# Math352Project

Welcome to the **Simple Fluid Simulator**!  
This project provides a basic fluid simulation using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with **GNU Octave**.

The simulator models fluid behavior based on simplified Navier-Stokes equations, and allows users to control key physical parameters through an easy-to-use interface.

You can fine any scientific details you need to know the file attached in this repo.
